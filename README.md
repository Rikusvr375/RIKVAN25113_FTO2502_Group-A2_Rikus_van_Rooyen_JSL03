# JSL03: Console-Based Task Manager

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple task management system where users can add up to three new tasks to an existing task array. Tasks are stored as objects in an array, each with a unique incremental ID. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management.

## Technologies used:
- VsCode  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GitHub

## Features created:
- a Feature that prompts a user for three different task titles, descriptions and a status for each one.  
- The status can only be "todo", "doing" or "done".  
- If the user enters an invalid status, they will be prompted consistently, until the enter a valid status.  
- If the user uses upper case in the status section, the program will correct it to lower case.  
- Each task has it's own incremented ID.  
- The user will be notified with the prompt ("There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console") when they have entered three more task's information.  
- The user will be able to see their task title, description and status in the console.  
- The user will be able to see an array apart from the previous one, that showcases all their tasks that are done.

## Expected Outcome

A **structured and limited task management system** that enables users to add, review, and filter tasks efficiently while ensuring **clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.**

**Console Log of all and completed tasks**
